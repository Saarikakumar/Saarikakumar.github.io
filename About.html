<p> My name is Saarika and I am recent college graduate. I attended Bryn Mawr college where I majored in Psychology and minored in computer science.
</p>

<p> For my psychology senior thesis, I conducted research on age differences in the processing of emotional stimuli in older and younger adults. My thesis received departmental honors.
</p>


<p> In addition to conducting psychology research, I have experience programming in Python and R. My recent projects can be found on my github. 
</p>

<p> I am passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and have experience programming in Python and R.  My passion for working with data began when I realized the power of data to inform decisions and policies on many levels. I am keen to dive into the field of data science and learn the various methods available for conducting data analysis.
</p>

<p> I am seeking a full-time role where I can apply software and data to solve real-world problems
