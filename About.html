<p> <font size="4"> My name is Saarika and I am a senior at Bryn Mawr College majoring in psychology and minoring in computer science.
</p>

<p> <font size="4"> This past summer, I conducted research on age differences in the processing of emotional stimuli in older and younger adults in the Cognition and Aging lab at Bryn Mawr College. For my senior thesis, I am extending this research and investigating the specific processing conditions under which these differences are observed.

<p> <font size="4"> At Bryn Mawr, I am on the E-board for EnAble, a club that provides a safe space for students with disabilities and their allies, and hosts events for community members.
</p>

<p> <font size="4"> This past semester, I worked on a project through the Teaching and Learning Institute to create a website on Universal Design for Learning. The websiteâ€™s goal is for professors to better understand Universal Design for Learning, and ensure that their classrooms are accessible.
</p>

<p> <font size="4"> I have a passion for data science and would like to explore the power of data to generate models and tell stories. My passion for data science began when I realized the power of data to inform decisions and policies on many levels. I am keen to dive into the field of data science and learn the various methods available for conducting data analysis.
