<p id="about">Hi! My name is Saarika and I am a senior Psychology major and Computer Science minor at Bryn Mawr College. My love for psychology began with my interest in understanding the way people learn, the way their brain works and why they behave in the ways that they do. I hope to combine my interests in Psychology and Computer Science to better the human experience. </p>

<p> This past summer, I participated in Bryn Mawr's Summer Science Research program as a research assistant in the cognition and aging lab. I conducted research on individual differences in attention and perception and ran both younger and older adults through a battery of paper and pencil and computer tasks. I also assisted with scoring data from past experiments conducted in the lab, as well as learned how to collect ERP (event-related potential) data. </p>

<p> In my free time, I can be found behind the camera, taking pictures of friends and family and travelling.
