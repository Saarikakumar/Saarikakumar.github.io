<p> My name is Saarika and I am a senior at Bryn Mawr College majoring in psychology and minoring in computer science.
</p>

<p> This past summer, I conducted research on age differences in the processing of emotional stimuli in older and younger adults in the Cognition and Aging lab at Bryn Mawr College.
  For my senior thesis, I am extending this research and investigating the specific processing conditions under which these differences are observed.
</p>

<p> I have a passion for data science and would like to explore the power of data to generate models and tell stories. My passion for data science began when I realized the power of data to inform decisions and policies on many levels. I am keen to dive into the field of data science and learn the various methods available for conducting data analysis.
</p>

<p> I am seeking a full-time role where I can apply software and data to solve real-world problems
